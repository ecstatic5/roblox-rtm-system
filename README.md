# Roblox RTM

Roblox RTM (Real Time Moderation) is a web application which will help you moderate your Roblox games remotely!

This project has been thought by `ecstaticfive` & `iiAngel`, it's an informal project and it's NOT professional at all, it's just a project for fun, but we wanted to help the Roblox developer community :)

This project still needs to be finished, we only have the main page.

> :warning: It is important for you to know that we are not professionals in frontend or backend development, we are just two young people with nothing better to do (basically xD) :warning:
